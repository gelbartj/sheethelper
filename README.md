# SheetHelper

SheetHelper is a tool designed to quickly merge two spreadsheets using people's names as keys. 

Background: At a previous job, I found myself constantly comparing spreadsheets that had been generated by two separate databases that used slightly different formatting rules for capitalization, punctuation (e.g. periods after middle initials), spacing, etc. So in order to reconcile the spreadsheets, I had to standardize the names every time before being able to do a vlookup in Excel. This tool solved all of that, automating the entire process in seconds.

This was my first (and only) Angular project. I completed it in July of 2016, just prior to the stable Angular 2.0 being released.

The original url is now defunct, but the tool is still available [here](https://sheet-helper-d46a1.web.app/).
